Page 243

At a conceptual level, holography seals the top-down approach to cosmology. The central tenet of holographic cosmology-that the 
past projects from a web of entangled quantum particles that form a lower-dimensional hologram - implies a top down view
of the universe. If, as holographic cosmology posits, the surface of our observations is in some sense all there is, then this builds in the backward-in-time
operation that is the hallmark of top-down cosmology. 

Holography tells us that **there is an entity more basic than time - a hologram - from which the past emerges**. (mlw_note: echoing some of Julian Barbour End of Time)
The evolving and expanding universe would be output, not input in a hoographic universe.

Holography paints a universe that is being continually created. It is as if there is a code, operating on countless entangled qubits,
that brings about physical reality, and this is what we perceive as the flow of time. In this sense holography places **the 
true origin of the universe in the distant future** because only the far future would reveal the hologram in its full glory.

(mlw note: find the morgan freeman episode with harvard quantum cosmologist, talks a max-complex point in far future
	"pulling" the universe forward to it . . . find that!)
